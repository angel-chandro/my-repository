# README

* **Dhalos_ROCKSTARhaloes** directory: contains files related to running ROCKSTAR haloes on DHaloes (or at least try it) that have been created or modified. The modifications and additions are briefly explained, but they can be observed more accurately in specific repository [Link](https://github.com/angel-chandro/DHalos_ROCKSTARhalos) or in my DHalos repository here [Link](https://github.com/angel-chandro/DHalos) (they can have comments attached).

* **hdf5** directory: contains python files to start learning how to work with hdf5 files (how to read them, how to create them...); hdf5 official webpage test (hdf5_test.py, myfile.hdf5) and also Violeta webpage test (hdf5_viotest.py, myfilevio.hdf5).

* **shell_script** directory: contains shell script test files. my-script.csh and my-script.sh are the ones from Violeta; submit.sh and ROCKSTAR_pid_upid_test.sh to run PID-UPID ratio; run_shark.sh to run shark with modified sample.cfg also in this repository.

* **sample.cfg**: modified SHARK parameter file.

* **ROCKSTAR_pid_upid_test.py**: python file that allows to calculate PID-UPID ratio from ConsistentTrees halo catalogues.

* **Tree_Shark.py**, **Tree_Shark_mod.py**: Guillermo's file that reads ConsistentTrees halo trees and a modification that works correctly.
